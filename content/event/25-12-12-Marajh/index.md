title: "Controlled regularity at future null infinity from past asymptotic initial data: the wave equation"
abstract: We study the relationship between asymptotic characteristic initial data for the wave equation at past null infinity and the regularity of the solution at future null infinity on the Minkowski spacetime. By constructing estimates on a causal rectangle reaching the conformal boundary, we prove that the solution admits an asymptotic expansion near null and spatial infinity whose regularity is controlled quantitatively in terms of the regularity of the data at past null infinity. In particular, our method gives rise to solutions to the wave equation in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity satisfying the peeling behaviour, for data on past null infinity with non-compact support. Our approach makes use of Friedrich's conformal representation of spatial infinity in which we prove delicate non-degenerate Grönwall estimates. We describe the relationship between the solution and the data both in terms of Friedrich's conformal coordinates and the usual physical coordinates on Minkowski space. This is joint work with Grigalius Taujanskas and Juan Valiente Kroon. The paper of the same title is available to read at [arXiv:2508.04690](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04690).
