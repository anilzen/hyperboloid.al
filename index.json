This evolution can be invariantly characterized by the dynamics of a set of multipoles. Unfortunately, the causal structure of space-time prevents the outside observers from directly witnessing it. However, thanks to Einstein’s equations, it is encoded in the profiles of gravitational waves observed at ${\\cal I}^+$: Using hyperboloid slices to connect the two, one can introduce a transform that reconstructs the late time dynamics of the horizon geometry using gravitational waveforms. Just as one monitors changes in the internal structure of objects from outside using electromagnetic tomography, one can image the horizon dynamics using gravitational waves at infinity.\nSebastiano Bernuzzi Friedrich Schiller University Jena\nThe binary black hole mergers laboratory The understanding of black hole mergers in general relativity heavily relies on numerical results in the test-mass limit to model the multipolar waveform and radiation reaction, the plunge dynamics, and quasi-normal-modes excitation. A successful approach combines perturbation theory (Teukolsky equation) with the effective-one-body dynamics for the test-body source. In this framework, hyperboloidal foliations are the key technical element that allows accurate numerical solutions of the time-domain (2+1) Teukolsky equation. The talk first reviews the methods and early results of this ““test-mass laboratory”” and then presents recent applications toward a faithful effective-one-body model for binary black holes on generic orbits.\nFlorian Beyer University of Otago\nAsymptotically hyperboloidal initial data sets from a parabolic-hyperbolic formulation of the Einstein vacuum constraints We discuss recent results regarding the asymptotics of solutions of certain evolutionary formulations of the Einstein-vacuum constraint equations based on previous work by Bartnik and Racz.\nMiguel Duarte Technical University of Lisbon\nAsymptotic systems in generalized harmonic gauge Starting from a generalization of the good-bad-ugly model, we showed that the solutions to the Einstein field equations in generalized harmonic gauge (GHG) admit polyhomogeneous expansions near null infinity. This allows us to find out, under some assumptions on initial data, whether the peeling property holds for each gauge choice. In general, we find that it does not. However we find that the interplay between gauge and constraint addition can be exploited in order to recover peeling. The same method can be used to build a regularization of the Einstein field equations in GHG.\nJörg Frauendiener University of Otago\nA global approach to the nonlinear perturbation of a black hole by gravitational waves It is well known that gravitational waves interact non-linearly. This makes it difficult to describe them rigorously. The cleanest description is based on a certain conformal invariance of the Einstein equations — a fact established by R. Penrose and used by H. Friedrich to prove several significant global results for general relativistic space-times. The so-called conformal field equations implement this conformal invariance on the level of partial differential equations. They provide various well-posed initial (boundary) value problems for use in different situations. The talk will give a computational perspective on the non-linear interaction of gravitational waves with an initially static (and spherically symmetric) black hole. We will show how to kick it and spin it up. The emergence of quasinormal modes and the constancy of the Newman-Penrose ““constants”” will be discussed.\nDejan Gajic Leipzig University\nLate-time tails and quasinormal modes Hyperboloidal foliations form a convenient tool for determining precisely how radiation of energy through null infinity results in decay in time of waves propagating on asymptotically flat spacetimes.

Minimal gauge was first proposed by Schinkel, Ansorg, and Macedo in 2013 and further formalised in the context of Schwarzschild, Reisnner-Nordstrom and Kerr spacetimes. The main advantage of minimal gauge over other smooth hyperboloidal foliations of the exterior Schwarzschild domain is its algebraic simplicity. The purpose of the post is to provide a derivation of minimal gauge that emphasizes this simplicity.\nTo bring things in context, we’ll start with regular coordinates across black-hole horizons, which are called horizon-penetrating.\nHorizon-penetrating coordinates Consider the 1+1 Schwarzschild spacetime with coordinates $(t,r)\\in (-\\infty,\\infty)\\times (1,\\infty)$ and metric $$ ds^2 = -f dt^2 + \\frac{1}{f} dr^2, \\qquad f := 1-\\frac{1}{r}.$$ For convenience, I scaled the mass parameter out of the Schwarzschild metric by redefining coordinates with the constant $2M$ scale factor. The metric above is singular at $r=1$.\nThis singularity caused a lot of confusion in the early years of general relativity. Today, we know that the singularity at the horizon is just a coordinate artefact. In fact, the coordinate location $r=1$ is not the three-dimensional horizon surface, but the two-dimensional bifurcation sphere (in 4D), which doesn’t exist in a reasonable, physical collapse scenario. The curvature is regular at the bifurcation sphere, so we can just transform the coordinate singularity away using a suitably regular time coordinate. Below is a Penrose diagram that demonstrates the intersection of the time slices at the bifurcation sphere, $\\mathcal{B}$.\nSchwarzschild time slices The simplest way to construct a regular time coordinate across the event horizon is via a height function $$ \\tau = t + h(r). \\tag{TT} \\label{TT} $$ The height function, $h(r)$, lifts up the time slices depending on the radial coordinate $r$. The first regular time coordinate across the Schwarzschild event horizon was devised independently by Painlevé and Gullstrand. Their height function $$ h_{\\textrm{PG}}(r) = \\ln(\\sqrt{r}-1) - \\ln(\\sqrt{r}+1) + 2 \\sqrt{r}, \\tag{PG} \\label{PG} $$ has a logarithmic singularity at the horizon. The resulting metric, $$ ds^2 = - f d\\tau^2 + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{r}} d\\tau dr + dr^2, $$ is regular. Another such time coordinate has been given by Eddington and Finkelstein1, also with a logarithmic singularity $$ h_{\\textrm{EF}}(r) = \\ln(r-1), \\tag{EF} \\label{EF} $$ leading to a regular metric $$ ds^2 = - f d\\tau^2 + \\frac{2}{r} d\\tau dr + \\left(1+\\frac{1}{r}\\right)dr^2. $$\nA common feature in both constructions is the logarithmic singularity of the height functions \\eqref{PG} and \\eqref{EF} near the horizon. This behavior is reasonable. Schwarzschild coordinates are singular at the bifurcation sphere, so it takes another singularity to fix it. The leading order behavior of both height functions near the horizon is $$ h_{\\textrm{horizon}}(r) \\sim \\ln(r-1). \\tag{horizon} \\label{horizon}$$ But why this particular logarithmic singularity?\nTo understand where this comes from, we need to follow the light. The null surfaces in Schwarzschild coordinates are given by $$ h_{\\textrm{null}}(r) = \\pm \\int \\frac{dr}{f(r)} = \\pm (r + \\ln |r-1|). \\tag{null} \\label{null} $$ The null rays are ingoing (regular at future horizon) for the positive sign, outgoing (regular at future null infinity) for the negative sign. The leading order behavior of ingoing null rays near the horizon is $\\sim\\ln(r-1)$, as it appears in both Gullstrand-Painlevé and Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, which explains why regular coordinates across the black-hole horizon in Schwarzschild spacetime must have this singularity structure in the height function.\nGullstrand-Painlevé time slices Eddington-Finkelstein time slices Above are the Penrose diagrams depicting the time slices for Gullstrand-Painlevé and Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates.\nInspecting these Penrose diagrams indicates that there is another intersection of time slices similar to the one we have just resolved near the bifurcation sphere. This time, the intersection is near spatial infinity. In fact, the height function for \\ref{null} rays blows up at infinity!\nWhat about infinity? The standard response to this observation is to ignore it because it happens at infinity. But there is a problem here with respect to the null structure. If you want a regular description of the energy propagation along both in- and outgoing null rays, you should use regular coordinates at both the horizon and infinity. The Penrose diagrams above clearly demonstrate that the time slices intersect at infinity. Not good!\nSo let’s pick a time coordinate that takes care of the singularity at infinity as well. The behavior we want near infinity is one of an outgoing null ray, i.e., the minus sign in …","date":1664409660,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664409660,"objectID":"b09da006621ee93bfebe37fcc3c4ff51","permalink":"https://hyperboloid.al/post/minimal-gauge/","publishdate":"2022-09-29T00:01:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/minimal-gauge/","section":"post","summary":"The minimal gauge is a hyperboloidal compactification promoted by Ansorg and Macedo.
