The hyperboloidal approach provides incredible efficiencies in the computation of wave equations across large domains. It also offers insights into the role of coordinates and observers in relativity, energy propagation, and the arrow of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The recognition of the hyperbolic nature of time slices in relativity has been dormant since first emphasized by Minkowski in 1909, except for a few dedicated researchers exploring the topic. However, the hyperboloidal approach has recently gained wide recognition as a valuable tool for studying wave propagation problems. They have been successfully employed in a wide range of problems covering mathematical analysis of nonlinear wave equations and different flavors of black-hole perturbation theory, including the effective-one-body and self-force approaches. We combine mathematical and numerical tools from differential geometry, conformal structure, partial differential equations, and numerical analysis to improve the study and computation of waves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This website promotes the hyperboloidal approach to researchers and the public. Through conferences, virtual seminars, expository blog posts, and review papers, our &lt;a href="https://hyperboloid.al/people">team&lt;/a> aims to make this topic more widely known. It is hoped that this coordinated effort will help resolve the remaining open problems in this area.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Titles and Abstracts for Copenhagen 23</title><link>https://hyperboloid.al/copenhagen-23-talks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hyperboloid.al/copenhagen-23-talks/</guid><description>&lt;p>Titles and abstracts complementing the &lt;a href="https://hyperboloid.al/event/copenhagen-23#schedule">schedule&lt;/a> of the &lt;a href="https://hyperboloid.al/event/copenhagen-23/">Infinity on a Gridshell&lt;/a> workshop in Copenhagen, July 10—13, 2023.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When black holes merge (or form by gravitational collapse), we have a common dynamical horizon whose geometry changes dramatically as it settles down to the final Kerr horizon. This evolution can be invariantly characterized by the dynamics of a set of multipoles. Unfortunately, the causal structure of space-time prevents the outside observers from directly witnessing it. However, &lt;em>thanks to Einstein&amp;rsquo;s equations&lt;/em>, it is encoded in the profiles of gravitational waves observed at ${\cal I}^+$: Using hyperboloid slices to connect the two, one can introduce a transform that reconstructs the &lt;em>late time&lt;/em> dynamics of the horizon geometry using gravitational waveforms. Just as one monitors changes in the internal structure of objects from outside using electromagnetic tomography, one can image the horizon dynamics using gravitational waves at infinity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The understanding of black hole mergers in general relativity heavily relies on numerical results in the test-mass limit to model the multipolar waveform and radiation reaction, the plunge dynamics, and quasi-normal-modes excitation. A successful approach combines perturbation theory (Teukolsky equation) with the effective-one-body dynamics for the test-body source. In this framework, hyperboloidal foliations are the key technical element that allows accurate numerical solutions of the time-domain (2+1) Teukolsky equation. The talk first reviews the methods and early results of this &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;test-mass laboratory&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; and then presents recent applications toward a faithful effective-one-body model for binary black holes on generic orbits.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Starting from a generalization of the good-bad-ugly model, we showed that the solutions to the Einstein field equations in generalized harmonic gauge (GHG) admit polyhomogeneous expansions near null infinity. This allows us to find out, under some assumptions on initial data, whether the peeling property holds for each gauge choice. In general, we find that it does not. However we find that the interplay between gauge and constraint addition can be exploited in order to recover peeling. The same method can be used to build a regularization of the Einstein field equations in GHG.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is well known that gravitational waves interact non-linearly. This makes it difficult to describe them rigorously. The cleanest description is based on a certain conformal invariance of the Einstein equations — a fact established by R. Penrose and used by H. Friedrich to prove several significant global results for general relativistic space-times. The so-called conformal field equations implement this conformal invariance on the level of partial differential equations. They provide various well-posed initial (boundary) value problems for use in different situations. The talk will give a computational perspective on the non-linear interaction of gravitational waves with an initially static (and spherically symmetric) black hole. We will show how to kick it and spin it up. The emergence of quasinormal modes and the constancy of the Newman-Penrose &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;constants&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; will be discussed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hyperboloidal foliations form a convenient tool for determining precisely how radiation of energy through null infinity results in decay in time of waves propagating on asymptotically flat spacetimes. I will present two applications of hyperboloidal foliations in black hole dynamics: 1) proving the existence of inverse-polynomial tails in the late-time asymptotics of waves propagating on black hole backgrounds, and 2) characterizing quasinormal modes as eigenfunctions of the infinitesimal generator of time-translations with respect to hyperboloidal foliations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A model system of equations that serves as a model for the Einstein field equation in generalised harmonic gauge called the good-bad-ugly system is studied in the region close to null and spatial infinity in Minkowski spacetime. This analysis is performed using H. Friedrich’s cylinder construction at spatial infinity and defining suitable conformally rescaled fields. The results are translated to the physical set up to investigate the relation between the polyhomogeneous expansions arising from the analysis of linear fields using the spatial-infinity-cylinder framework and those obtained through a heuristic method based on Hormander’s asymptotic system.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One symmetric hyperbolic formulation of the Einstein Field Equations (EFEs) is in generalized harmonic gauge. The choice of gauge is generally related to the coordinates used to cast the EFEs within a spacetime foliation. A naive choice of gauge adapted to hyperboloidal coordinates may not be the most optimal way to solve
the EFEs on these slices. In this talk, we shall discuss a choice of compactified hyperboloidal coordinates that not only are physically motivated but also facilitate mapping future-null infinity onto a finite computational grid. We decouple our choice of gauge from this choice of coordinates to maintain the hyperbolicity of the EFEs via the dual-foliation formalism. We introduce a numerical scheme that assures stability for a class of linear hyperbolic systems on these slices. Finally, we discuss the possibility of extending this numerical scheme for studying initial value problems for the EFEs on these slices.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the 2030s LISA is due to be launched, providing the opportunity to extract physics from stellar objects
and systems that would not otherwise be possible, among which are EMRIs. Unlike previous sources detected
at LIGO, these sources can be simulated using an accurate computation of the gravitational self-force.
Whereas the field has seen outstanding progress in the frequency domain, metric reconstruction and self-force
calculations are still an open challenge in the time domain. Such computations would not only further corroborate
frequency domain calculations/models but also allow for full self-consistent evolution of the orbit under
the effect of the self-force .
Given we have a priori information about the local structure of the discontinuity at the particle,
we will show how we can construct discontinuous spatial and temporal discretizations by operating on
discontinuous Lagrange and Hermite interpolation formulae and hence recover higher order accuracy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We show how this technique in conjunction with well-suited conformal (hyperboloidal slicing) and numerical
(discontinuous time symmetric) methods can provide a relatively simple method of lines numerical recipe approach
to the problem. We will start by reviewing our algorithm at the light of the wave equation and finally share our
results for both the scalar and gravitational self-force cases for a particle in a circular orbit on a Schwarzschild
background. In the spirit of the workshop we focus on highlighting important intermediary steps and results singular
to using hyperboloidal foliations hopefully addressing outstanding concerns and further motivate its implementation
in present and future gravitational TD codes as a simpler and highly accurate alternative to boundary conditions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Accurate numerical relativity simulations are a crucial ingredient for
waveform models that allow to identify the sources of gravitational
wave signals, and the further development of numerical relativity
methods is essential for gravitational wave astronomy. In this talk I
will give a brief overview about how numerical relativity simulations
are used in waveform modelling, and I will review the status of
numerical relativity techniques and compare with the accuracy
requirements of current and future detectors. I will place this
discussion into the context of the ambitions of the hyperboloidal
approach, and I will in particular discuss issues of wave extraction

&lt;p>Assessing the structural stability of Quasi-Normal Mode (QNM) frequencies of self-gravitating compact objects is an important open problem in general relativity and its extensions, given the fundamental role that QNMs play in diverse areas of gravitational physics. A particular avenue to this problem is potentially provided by Kato’s perturbation theory of linear operators. However, such an approach requires first to cast QNMs in terms of a proper eigenvalue problem, in particular with proper (finite norm) QNM eigenfunctions in a Hilbert space. The hyperboloidal approach to (black hole) perturbations provides a geometric approach to such a characterization of QNMs in terms of the spectrum of a non-selfadjoint operator. In this talk we discuss some of the concepts and tools employed in this context, imported from the spectral theory of non-selfadjoint operators. Focus will be placed on the notion of pseudospectrum, paying special attention to the open issues needed to be addressed before any sound conclusion can be reached about QNM instability.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Quasinormal modes are the gravitational wave analogue to the overtones heard after striking a bell. They dominate the signal observed during the ringdown phase after a dynamical event and are characterised by complex frequencies, which encode oscillation and exponential decay in time. As horizons become extremal, various computations (both analytic and numerical) have shown that in many cases, there exists a sequence of frequencies which become purely oscillatory in the limit and which cluster on a line in the complex plane. These are zero-damped modes and are conjectured to exist generically for near-extremal horizons. In this talk, we shall discuss rigorous results that can be obtained toward resolving this question by using a hyperboloidal foliation of the background spacetime.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Gravitational self-force theory is the leading approach for modelling gravitational wave emission from small mass-ratio compact binaries. This method perturbatively expands the metric of the binary in powers of the mass ratio. The source for the perturbations depends on the orbital configuration, calculational approach, and/or the order in which the perturbative expansion is carried. These sources fall into three broad classes: distributional, extended and compact, and non-compact. The latter, in particular, is important for emerging second-order in the mass ratio calculations. Traditional frequency domain approaches employ the variation of parameters method and compute the perturbation on constant time slices of the spacetime with numerical boundary conditions supplied at a finite radius from series expansions of the asymptotic behaviour. This approach has been very successful, but the boundary conditions calculations are tedious, and the approach is not well suited to non-compact sources where homogeneous solutions must be computed at all radii. In this talk, I outline an alternative approach where horizon-penetrating hyperboloidal slices foliate the spacetime. Further compactifying the coordinates along these slices allows for simple treatment of the boundary conditions. We implement this approach with a multi-domain spectral solver with analytic mesh refinement and present results for the scalar-field self-force on circular orbits as an example problem. We find the method works efficiently for all three classes of sources encountered in self-force calculations and has some distinct advantages over the traditional approach.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I will present recent developments on the dynamics of self-gravitating massive fields. In collaboration with Yue Ma, I established the global nonlinear stability of self-gravitating Klein-Gordon fields in the near-Minkowski regime, when the metric enjoys only low decay at spacelike infinity. To this purpose we developed the Euclidean-Hyperboloidal Foliation Method, as we call it, which applies to coupled systems of nonlinear wave and Klein-Gordon equations. In collaboration with Bruno Le Floch (LHEP, Sorbonne) and T.C. Nguyen (Paris), I introduced the localized Seed-to-Solution Method and constructed classes of asymptotically Euclidean solutions to the Einstein constraints under prescribed asymptotic conditions at infinity. Our solutions are localized at the super-harmonic rates in cone-like domains at spacelike infinity. In collaboration with B. Le Floch and G. Veneziano (CERN, Geneva), I studied the bouncing behavior in the vicinity of gravitational singularity and proposed the notion of singularity scattering maps in order to describe the junction conditions.

We give details of an ongoing effort to construct a spectral 1+1D code which utilises a hyperboloidal foliation which aims to drastically increase the accuracy of the calculations and discuss the extension of the scheme to the gravitational case.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This talk outlines a fast, high-precision time-domain solver for scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations on hyperboloidal foliations of Kerr space-times. Time-domain Teukolsky equation solvers have typically used explicit methods, which numerically violate Noether symmetries and are Courant-limited. These restrictions can limit the performance of explicit schemes when simulating long-time extreme mass ratio inspirals, expected to appear in the LISA band for 2-5 years. We outline work on using symmetric (exponential, Padé, or Hermite) integrators, which are unconditionally stable and known to preserve certain Noether symmetries and phase-space volume. For linear hyperbolic equations, these implicit integrators can be cast in explicit form, making them well-suited for long-time evolution of black hole perturbations. The 1+1 modal Teukolsky equation is discretized in space using polynomial collocation methods and reduced to a linear system of ordinary differential equations coupled via mode-coupling arrays and discretized differential operators. Hyperboloidal methods, combined with a matricization technique, allow us to cast the mode-coupled system in a form amenable to a method-of-lines framework, which dramatically simplifies numerical implementation and enables efficient parallelization on CPU and GPU architectures. We present tests of our numerical code on late-time tails of Kerr spacetime perturbations in the sub-extremal and extremal cases.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this talk, I will discuss how Friedrich’s representation of spatial infinity can be used to study asymptotic expansions of the Maxwell-scalar field system near spatial infinity. In this framework, spatial infinity is represented by a cylinder connecting the endpoints of past and future null infinity, namely the critical sets. This formulation allows us to relate the behaviour of the fields at the critical sets with their initial value on a fiduciary Cauchy hypersurface. The main objective of this analysis is to understand the effects of the non-linearities of the system on the regularity of solutions and polyhomogeneous expansions at null infinity and, in particular, at the critical sets. The main result of this analysis is that the non-linear interaction makes both fields more singular at the conformal boundary than what is seen when the fields are non-interacting. In particular, there is a whole new class of logarithmic terms in the asymptotic expansions, which depend on the coupling constant between the Maxwell and scalar fields.&lt;/p>

After reviewing prior results on wave equations satisfying special cases of this weak null condition, we will present a new approach to establishing the existence of solutions to these system of wave equations near spatial infinity that requires no additional assumptions beyond the boundedness of solutions to the associated asymptotic equation, which is in the spirit of the weak null conjecture by Lindblad and Rodnianski. As we will discuss in some detail during the talk, the proof relies on a cylinder at infinity construction and formulating the wave equations as a Fuchsian system of equations. Time permitting, we will discuss open problems and future directions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The main usefulness of hyperboloidal numerical methods is the clean capture of the radiation signal at future null infinity. To do so, the asymptotic decay of the evolved fields has to be known a priori to get regular variables throughout the whole numerical grid. In this talk I will present 3+1-dimensional numerical results of a model that captures the asymptotics of General Relativity in Generalized Harmonic Gauge for a particular choice of metric variables that have a clean asymptotic hierarchy. Moreover, I will discuss the status of spherical evolutions in Numerical Relativity within this scenario and give a perspective on full 3D hyperboloidal simulations in GR.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In second-order self-force theory, two types of infrared divergences arise due to the large-r behavior of the source terms in the second-order field equations. Both types are associated with the slow evolution of the binary system, but they have different underlying causes and very different manifestations. One type can be straightforwardly eliminated by adopting asymptotically null slicing. The second type, associated with hereditary dynamics and gravitational-wave memory, persists regardless of the choice of slicing. This more pernicious type can be eliminated by combining asymptotically null slicing with a Bondi-type gauge condition on the metric perturbation, enforcing that the background slices remain asymptotically null in the perturbed spacetime.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The upcoming space-borne gravitational wave detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is primarily sensitive to Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRI) where the mass ratio between two black holes is higher than $10^5$. For the matched filtering process, we need a highly accurate template wave bank. In this talk, I will describe a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for simulating waveforms from EMRI systems. We reduce the Teukolsky equation, which governs the behavior of EMRIs, to a set of coupled 1+1D wave equations and apply the DG method to it with a delta source term, acting like the secondary black hole in an EMRI system. Unlike other numerical schemes, our DG method can exactly incorporate the point particle behavior of the smaller black hole in the form of a delta function. Due to the spectral convergence properties of the scheme, our efficient method generates highly accurate waveforms in a very short time as compared to other methods. We have also introduced the hyperboloidal layers in our time domain solver that gives us access to the solution at null infinity. We verify our computation by computing Price tail power laws and scalar energy fluxes at null infinity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Perturbations of Kerr spacetime are typically studied with the Teukolsky formalism, in which a pair of gauge invariant components of the perturbed Weyl tensor are expressed in terms of separable modes that satisfy ordinary differential equations. However, for certain applications it is desirable to construct the full metric perturbation in the Lorenz gauge, in which the linearized Einstein field equations take a manifestly hyperbolic form. Directly solving the Lorenz gauge equations in Kerr spacetime is challenging for two reasons: (i) unlike the Teukolsky equation, the Lorenz gauge equations are not known to admit separable solutions; (ii) the equations for the ten components of the metric perturbation are coupled. In this talk, I will present a formalism in which the Lorenz gauge metric perturbation is obtained from a set of six decoupled and separable solutions to the spin-2, spin-1 and spin-0 Teukolsky equations. The formalism is ideally suited to hyperboloidal methods, which have been shown to provide a highly-efficient approach to solving Teukolsky equations. As a demonstration of the approach, I will give results for the Lorenz-gauge gravitational self-force problem in Kerr spacetime. This talk is based on work with Sam Dolan, Chris Kavanagh and Leanne Durkan.&lt;/p>

Minimal gauge was first proposed by &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6984" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schinkel, Ansorg, and Macedo&lt;/a> in 2013 and further formalised in the context of &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02261" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schwarzschild&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02837" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reisnner-Nordstrom&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kerr&lt;/a> spacetimes. The main advantage of minimal gauge over other smooth hyperboloidal foliations of the exterior Schwarzschild domain is its algebraic simplicity. The purpose of the post is to provide a derivation of minimal gauge that emphasizes this simplicity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To bring things in context, we&amp;rsquo;ll start with regular coordinates across black-hole horizons, which are called horizon-penetrating.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="horizon-penetrating-coordinates">Horizon-penetrating coordinates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Consider the 1+1 Schwarzschild spacetime with coordinates $(t,r)\in (-\infty,\infty)\times (1,\infty)$ and metric
$$ ds^2 = -f dt^2 + \frac{1}{f} dr^2, \qquad f := 1-\frac{1}{r}.$$
For convenience, I scaled the mass parameter out of the Schwarzschild metric by redefining coordinates with the constant $2M$ scale factor. The metric above is singular at $r=1$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This singularity caused a lot of confusion in the early years of general relativity. Today, we know that the singularity at the horizon is just a coordinate artefact. In fact, the coordinate location $r=1$ is not the three-dimensional horizon surface, but the two-dimensional bifurcation sphere (in 4D), which doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in a reasonable, physical collapse scenario. The curvature is regular at the bifurcation sphere, so we can just transform the coordinate singularity away using a suitably regular time coordinate. Below is a Penrose diagram that demonstrates the intersection of the time slices at the bifurcation sphere, $\mathcal{B}$.&lt;/p>

Schwarzschild time slices

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The simplest way to construct a regular time coordinate across the event horizon is via a height function
$$ \tau = t + h(r). \tag{TT} \label{TT} $$
The height function, $h(r)$, lifts up the time slices depending on the radial coordinate $r$. The first regular time coordinate across the Schwarzschild event horizon was devised independently by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullstrand%E2%80%93Painlev%C3%A9_coordinates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Painlevé and Gullstrand&lt;/a>. Their height function
$$ h_{\textrm{PG}}(r) = \ln(\sqrt{r}-1) - \ln(\sqrt{r}+1) + 2 \sqrt{r}, \tag{PG} \label{PG} $$
has a logarithmic singularity at the horizon. The resulting metric,
$$ ds^2 = - f d\tau^2 + \frac{2}{\sqrt{r}} d\tau dr + dr^2, $$
is regular. Another such time coordinate has been given by Eddington and Finkelstein&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, also with a logarithmic singularity
$$ h_{\textrm{EF}}(r) = \ln(r-1), \tag{EF} \label{EF} $$
leading to a regular metric
$$ ds^2 = - f d\tau^2 + \frac{2}{r} d\tau dr + \left(1+\frac{1}{r}\right)dr^2. $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A common feature in both constructions is the logarithmic singularity of the height functions \eqref{PG} and \eqref{EF} near the horizon. This behavior is reasonable. Schwarzschild coordinates are singular at the bifurcation sphere, so it takes another singularity to fix it. The leading order behavior of both height functions near the horizon is
$$ h_{\textrm{horizon}}(r) \sim \ln(r-1). \tag{horizon} \label{horizon}$$
But why this particular logarithmic singularity?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To understand where this comes from, we need to follow the light. The null surfaces in Schwarzschild coordinates are given by
$$ h_{\textrm{null}}(r) = \pm \int \frac{dr}{f(r)} = \pm (r + \ln |r-1|). \tag{null} \label{null} $$
The null rays are ingoing (regular at future horizon) for the positive sign, outgoing (regular at future null infinity) for the negative sign. The leading order behavior of ingoing null rays near the horizon is $\sim\ln(r-1)$, as it appears in both Gullstrand-Painlevé and Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, which explains why regular coordinates across the black-hole horizon in Schwarzschild spacetime must have this singularity structure in the height function.&lt;/p>

&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Above are the Penrose diagrams depicting the time slices for Gullstrand-Painlevé and Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Inspecting these Penrose diagrams indicates that there is another intersection of time slices similar to the one we have just resolved near the bifurcation sphere. This time, the intersection is near spatial infinity. In fact, the height function for \ref{null} rays blows up at infinity!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-about-infinity">What about infinity?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The standard response to this observation is to ignore it because it happens at infinity. But there is a problem here with respect to the null structure. If you want a regular description of the energy propagation along &lt;em>both&lt;/em> in- and outgoing null rays, you should use regular coordinates at both the horizon and infinity. The Penrose diagrams above clearly demonstrate that the time slices intersect at infinity. Not good!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So let&amp;rsquo;s pick a time coordinate that takes care of the singularity at infinity as well. The behavior we want near infinity is one of an outgoing null ray, i.e., the minus sign in \eqref{null} with the leading order terms
$$ h_{\textrm{infinity}}\sim - r - \ln r. \tag{infinity} \label{infinity}$$
To construct our desired time coordinate, we need to combine the two desired behaviors near the \ref{horizon} and \ref{infinity}. But we must be careful that the horizon height function doesn&amp;rsquo;t mess up the infinity behavior, so we&amp;rsquo;ll take off its leading large $r$ term, like this
$$ h_{\textrm{horizon}}(r) \sim \ln|r-1| - \textcolor{green}{\ln r}. $$
The green term cancels the $r\to \infty$ behavior of the horizon height function.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- (series expansion for large $r$: $\ln(r-1) = \ln r - 1/r + O(1/r^2)$). -->
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re finally ready to construct the gauge that connects the horizon and null infinity smoothly. We simply combine these two behaviors and get the minimal gauge:
$$ h_{\textrm{MG}}(r) = \ln|r-1| - 2 \ln r - r. \tag{MG} \label{MG}$$
In a sense, this is the simplest, or minimal, choice you can make respecting the leading order behaviors of the horizon and infinity height functions with respect to ingoing and outgoing null rays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The metric in this minimal gauge reads
$$ ds^2 = -f d\tau^2 - 2 \left(1-\frac{2}{r^2}\right) d\tau dr + \frac{4(1+r)}{r^3} dr^2,. $$
You can now apply your favorite spatial compactification to the radial coordinate so that the entire exterior Schwarzschild domain is mapped regularly to a finite domain that fits well into a computer. For example, compactification with $\sigma:=1/r$ maps the exterior domain $r\in[1,\infty)$ to $\sigma\in[0,1]$, where $\sigma=0$ is null infinity and $\sigma=1$ is the horizon with metric
$$ ds^2 = \frac{1}{\sigma^2} \left(-f \sigma^2 d\tau^2 + 2 (1-2\sigma^2) d\tau d\sigma + 4 (1+\sigma) d\sigma^2\right). $$
Below is the obligatory Penrose diagram. The slices are smoothly extending between the future event horizon and future null infinity, beautifully covering the exterior domain of Schwarzschild spacetime.

&lt;p>The minimal gauge is a relatively new set of coordinates, having appeared only in &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6984" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2013&lt;/a>. Remarkably, there is a connection between the minimal gauge and a widely known method to calculate ringing frequencies of black holes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When a black hole is perturbed, it rings with a characteristic frequency spectrum while emitting away the energy of the perturbation in a ringdown, just like a musical instrument, or a glass that has been tapped with a knife. Such decaying oscillatory perturbations are called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasinormal_mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quasi-normal modes&lt;/a>. The details of the ringdown, such as the frequency of oscillations and the rate of decay, depend on the physical parameters of the black hole. There is a vibrant research direction called black-hole spectroscopy that studies such black-hole quasi-normal modes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most prevalent method to compute black-hole ringdown frequencies was presented in a 1985 &lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2397876" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper&lt;/a> by Leaver. The first step in Leaver&amp;rsquo;s method is to write the perturbations in frequency domain via a Fourier transformation. For simplicity, we assume a scalar perturbation causing a harmonic oscillation with a single frequency $\omega$. We can then separate the space and time dependence of the perturbative field, $\phi(t,r)$, as
$$\phi(t,r) = e^{i\omega t}\psi(r).$$
It turns out that the frequency-domain perturbation blows up both near the horizon and near infinity. This perturbation blow-up is a consequence of the equations that the black-hole perturbations satisfy when they are written in Schwarzschild coordinates. You will immediately recognize the issue from our previous discussion. The perturbation blows up simply because the Schwarzschild time slices intersect both near the horizon and near infinity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pathology of Schwarzschild time slices and its relationship to the pathologies of black-hole perturbations were not recognized during Leaver&amp;rsquo;s time. Instead, Leaver used traditional tools from the theory of ordinary differential equations and suggested a rescaling to pick up the perturbative field&amp;rsquo;s pathological behavior
$$
\psi(r) = r^{2i\omega} \left(r - 1\right)^{-i\omega} e^{i\omega r} \overline \psi_{\rm L}(r). \tag{L}\label{L}
$$
He then performed a Taylor expansion around the horizon for the regularized perturbation
$$
\overline \psi_{\rm L}(r) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \left( 1-\frac{1}{r} \right)^k.
$$
The coefficients of the expansion, $a_k$, satisfy a $3$-term recurence relation which we can now iteratively solve for. This method is the most common method to compute black-hole frequencies to this day.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-geometric-framework">A geometric framework&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is not immediately clear where Leaver&amp;rsquo;s regularization in \eqref{L} comes from. We can, however, solve the problem of perturbation blow-up that motivated Leaver&amp;rsquo;s regularization in a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.2451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geometric way&lt;/a> by switching to regular coordinates. The time transformation with a height function as in \eqref{TT} translates to a rescaling of the perturbation in frequency domain. To see this, note that the scalar perturbation in the new time $\tau$ is the same as the perturbation in Schwarzschild time
$$ \phi(\tau,r) = \phi(t+h(r),r) = \phi(t,r).$$
The separation ansatz then implies
$$\phi(\tau,r) = e^{i\omega \tau} \overline\psi(r) = e^{i\omega t} e^{i \omega h} \overline\psi(r) = e^{i\omega t} \psi(r).$$
Therefore, the irregular perturbation in Schwarzschild time, $\psi(r)$, is related to the perturbation in transformed time, $\overline\psi(r)$, as
$$ \psi(r) = e^{i \omega h} \overline\psi(r).$$
The most important property here is that the transformed perturbation, $\overline \psi(r)$, is regular at the horizon and infinity due to the leading order singular behavior of the height function in these regimes, which picks up the blow-up of the Schwarzschild perturbation, $\psi(r)$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make the connection between Leaver&amp;rsquo;s regularization and the time transformation \eqref{TT}, we rewrite Leaver&amp;rsquo;s regularization in \eqref{L} as
\begin{eqnarray}
r^{2i\omega} \left(r - 1\right)^{-i\omega} &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; e^{-2i\omega\ln r} e^{i\omega \ln(r-1)} e^{-i\omega r} \newline
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp; e^{i\omega (-2 \ln r + \ln (r-1) - r)}.
\end{eqnarray}
Remarkably, this is &lt;strong>exactly&lt;/strong> the same function as the minimal gauge height function given in \eqref{MG}! Leaver&amp;rsquo;s regular field $\overline\psi_{\rm L}(r)$ is the frequency-domain representation of the hyperboloidal pertubation field $\phi(\tau,r)$ in the minimal gauge.&lt;/p>

## Event and Cauchy Horizons: the role of the compactification
The geometrical approach unveils an even richer structure for spacetimes containing a Cauchy horizon $r_{c}$ apart from the event horizon $r_h$. The most straightfoward exemples are charged and rotating black holes, described the well-known Reisnner-Nordstrom and Kerr spacetimes, respectvely.
Usually, these solutions are parametrised by another paramerter apart from the black hole mass M: the electric charged $Q$ in the Reisnner-Nordstrom case, or the angular momentum $a$ for the Kerr solution. These parameters are restricted to values $|Q|/M\leq 1$ and $|a|/M\leq 1$. The equality holds in the the so-called extremal black holes. In such cases, it follows that the event and Cauchy horizons coincide.
Because we are opting to normalise the event horizon to unit, a more conveninet parameter in terms of the ratio between the event and Cauchy horizon via
$$
\kappa^2 = \dfrac{r_c}{r_h} = r_{c}^{-1}.
$$
Indeed, one can verify that $\kappa = Q/r_{h}$ (Reisnner-Nordstrom) or $\kappa=a/r_{h}$ (Kerr), which reduces to the usual charge and angular momentum parameters when $r_h=1$. Besides, this parameter takes values in the range $|\kappa|\in[0,1]$, with $\kappa=0$ describing the Schwarzschild space time, and $\kappa\rightarrow 1$ the extremal limit.
Constructing the minimal gauge for these spacetimes follows a similar strategy as described previously, i.e., a deformation of the time coordinate $t$ via the height function $h$, and a compactification of radial coordinate $r$. Here, we consider both transformations and we focus on the role played by the choice of compactification function within the minimal gauge. Specifically, we transform the coordinates $(t,r)$ into $(\tau,\sigma)$ via
\begin{eqnarray}
t = \tau - h(\sigma), \quad r = \dfrac{\rho(\sigma)}{\sigma}.
\end{eqnarray}
In the miminal gauge, the height function has the form
$$
h(\sigma) = h_{null}^-(r(\sigma)) + \delta h(\sigma), \quad \delta h(\sigma) = 2\left(\ln \sigma -\sigma^{-1} \right)
$$
with $h_{null}^-$ the solution with negative sign in \ref{null}.
The influce of the radial compactification in the coordinate transformation is capture by the function $\beta(\sigma) \equiv \rho'(\sigma) - \sigma \rho(\sigma)$. The minimal gauge imposes the simple value $\beta(\sigma) = 1$, which translates into
$$
\rho(\sigma) = \rho_0 + (1-\rho_0) \sigma.
$$
This choice already considers the event horizon fixed at $r_h=1 \leftrightarrow$ $\sigma_h=1$.
Of course, the most simple option is just just set $\rho_0=1$, from which we recover the compactification $r=1/\sigma$. Besides, with this choice, the Cauchy horizon assumes the coordinate value $\sigma_c= \kappa^{-2}$. Thus, we observe that the coordinate location of the Cauchy horizon moves continously along the grid from $\sigma_c\rightarrow \infty$, i.e., the singularity in the Schwarzschild spacetime when $\kappa=0$, up to $\sigma_c = \sigma_h = 1$ in the extremal case $\kappa^2=1$. With this choice of hyperboloidal compactification, the line element in the limit $\kappa^2=1$ corresponds to the usual representation of extreme black holes.
Interstingly, we can exploit the parameter $\rho_0$ to actually fix the Cauchy horizon at a given coordinate grid. In particular, the choice $\rho_0 = 1 - \kappa^2$ leads to the radial compactification
$$
r = \dfrac{ 1 - \kappa^2(1-\sigma)}{\sigma}.
$$
This choice ernsures that the Cauchy horizon is always at $\sigma_c\rightarrow \infty$, regardless of $|\kappa| \in [0, 1)$. We will refer to this choice as Cauchy Horizon fixing minimal gauge.
However, the transformation (and therefore the underlying line element) is ill-defined for $\kappa^2 = 1$ as it reduces to $r=1$. However, a well-defined limit for the metric components is achieved if we re-scale the time coordinate accordingly to $\tau \rightarrow \tau/(1-\kappa^2)$. Even though, the radial and time re-scaling are singular in the extremal limit $\kappa^2 \rightarrow 1$, the line element is well-defined and describes the so-called near-horizon geometry of extremal black holes. The discontinous limiting process is not a feature of the coordinate transformation. The geometry of extremal black-holes in the near-horizon regime is also discontious in the sense that future null infinity changes its character from being a lightlike surface (asymptotically flat spacetime) to being timelike (asymptotically $AdS_2$ spacetime).
Going back to Leaver's approach to regularise the equations in the frequency domain, it is well-known that his approaches fails in the extremal limit. In other words, an algorithm for computing the QNM of extremal black-hols following his initial ideas cannot be achieve in a continous way, but rahter one must be considered the line element in its extremal regime from scratch. While this limiation has been understood just as caveat of the algorithm, the hyperboloidal approach shows that the limitation is actually a consequence of discontinous transition to the near-horizon geometry (and its change in topology) in the extremal case.
Indeed, in this post, we saw that Leaver's regularisation choice follows naturally from the hyperboloidal transformation via a pre-factor $e^{i\omega h}$. It turns out that, for spacetimes containing a Cauchy horizon, Leaver's regularization factor corresponds exactly to the hyperboloidal formulation in the {\it Cauchy Horizon fixing minimal gauge}. Thus, the algorithm's breakdown is a consequence of the discontinous limit into the near-horizon geometry.
