title: "Construction of hyperboloidal initial data without logarithmic singularities"
abstract: General hyperboloidal initial data obtained using the elliptic method are known to contain poly-logarithmic singularities. In this lecture, we will present an argument concluding that, when the Bondi energy and momentum are well-defined, generic solutions to the parabolic–hyperbolic form of these constraints are free of logarithmic singularities.
