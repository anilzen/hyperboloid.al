Minimal gauge was first proposed by Schinkel, Ansorg, and Macedo in 2013 and further formalised in the context of Schwarzschild, Reisnner-Nordstrom and Kerr spacetimes. The main advantage of minimal gauge over other smooth hyperboloidal foliations of the exterior Schwarzschild domain is its algebraic simplicity. The purpose of the post is to provide a derivation of minimal gauge that emphasizes this simplicity.\nTo bring things in context, we’ll start with regular coordinates across black-hole horizons, which are called horizon-penetrating.\nHorizon-penetrating coordinates Consider the 1+1 Schwarzschild spacetime with coordinates $(t,r)\\in (-\\infty,\\infty)\\times (1,\\infty)$ and metric $$ ds^2 = -f dt^2 + \\frac{1}{f} dr^2, \\qquad f := 1-\\frac{1}{r}.$$ For convenience, I scaled the mass parameter out of the Schwarzschild metric by redefining coordinates with the constant $2M$ scale factor. The metric above is singular at $r=1$.\nThis singularity caused a lot of confusion in the early years of general relativity. Today, we know that the singularity at the horizon is just a coordinate artefact. In fact, the coordinate location $r=1$ is not the three-dimensional horizon surface, but the two-dimensional bifurcation sphere (in 4D), which doesn’t exist in a reasonable, physical collapse scenario. The curvature is regular at the bifurcation sphere, so we can just transform the coordinate singularity away using a suitably regular time coordinate. Below is a Penrose diagram that demonstrates the intersection of the time slices at the bifurcation sphere, $\\mathcal{B}$.\nSchwarzschild time slices The simplest way to construct a regular time coordinate across the event horizon is via a height function $$ \\tau = t + h(r). \\tag{TT} \\label{TT} $$ The height function, $h(r)$, lifts up the time slices depending on the radial coordinate $r$. The first regular time coordinate across the Schwarzschild event horizon was devised independently by Painlevé and Gullstrand. Their height function $$ h_{\\textrm{PG}}(r) = \\ln(\\sqrt{r}-1) - \\ln(\\sqrt{r}+1) + 2 \\sqrt{r}, \\tag{PG} \\label{PG} $$ has a logarithmic singularity at the horizon. The resulting metric, $$ ds^2 = - f d\\tau^2 + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{r}} d\\tau dr + dr^2, $$ is regular. Another such time coordinate has been given by Eddington and Finkelstein1, also with a logarithmic singularity $$ h_{\\textrm{EF}}(r) = \\ln(r-1), \\tag{EF} \\label{EF} $$ leading to a regular metric $$ ds^2 = - f d\\tau^2 + \\frac{2}{r} d\\tau dr + \\left(1+\\frac{1}{r}\\right)dr^2. $$\nA common feature in both constructions is the logarithmic singularity of the height functions \\eqref{PG} and \\eqref{EF} near the horizon. This behavior is reasonable. Schwarzschild coordinates are singular at the bifurcation sphere, so it takes another singularity to fix it. The leading order behavior of both height functions near the horizon is $$ h_{\\textrm{horizon}}(r) \\sim \\ln(r-1). \\tag{horizon} \\label{horizon}$$ But why this particular logarithmic singularity?\nTo understand where this comes from, we need to follow the light. The null surfaces in Schwarzschild coordinates are given by $$ h_{\\textrm{null}}(r) = \\pm \\int \\frac{dr}{f(r)} = \\pm (r + \\ln |r-1|). \\tag{null} \\label{null} $$ The null rays are ingoing (regular at future horizon) for the positive sign, outgoing (regular at future null infinity) for the negative sign. The leading order behavior of ingoing null rays near the horizon is $\\sim\\ln(r-1)$, as it appears in both Gullstrand-Painlevé and Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, which explains why regular coordinates across the black-hole horizon in Schwarzschild spacetime must have this singularity structure in the height function.\nGullstrand-Painlevé time slices Eddington-Finkelstein time slices Above are the Penrose diagrams depicting the time slices for Gullstrand-Painlevé and Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates.\nInspecting these Penrose diagrams indicates that there is another intersection of time slices similar to the one we have just resolved near the bifurcation sphere. This time, the intersection is near spatial infinity. In fact, the height function for \\ref{null} rays blows up at infinity!\nWhat about infinity? The standard response to this observation is to ignore it because it happens at infinity. But there is a problem here with respect to the null structure. If you want a regular description of the energy propagation along both in- and outgoing null rays, you should use regular coordinates at both the horizon and infinity. The Penrose diagrams above clearly demonstrate that the time slices intersect at infinity. Not good!\nSo let’s pick a time coordinate that takes care of the singularity at infinity as well. The behavior we want near infinity is one of an outgoing null ray, i.e., the minus sign in …","date":1664409660,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664409660,"objectID":"b09da006621ee93bfebe37fcc3c4ff51","permalink":"https://hyperboloid.al/post/minimal-gauge/","publishdate":"2022-09-29T00:01:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/minimal-gauge/","section":"post","summary":"The minimal gauge is a hyperboloidal compactification promoted by Ansorg and Macedo.

Often, qualitative diagrams are sufficient if you’re mainly interested in the essential causal relationships. But sometimes, for numerical work or for your own understanding, you need a quantitatively correct diagram.\nBelow, we draw Penrose diagrams using free and open-source software. We’ll draw the diagrams using the LaTeX package TikZ (not a drawing program but a program that draws2). We’ll use Python to perform transformations when we hit the computational limitations of TikZ.\nThe code for all diagrams below is on my website repository. The basic idea behind Penrose diagrams The Penrose diagram is an extension, or better, a completion of the Minkowski diagram. Like in the Minkowski diagram, time is vertical, space is horizontal, and null rays are at 45 degrees to the axes. In contrast to the Minkowski diagram, a Penrose diagram includes “points at infinity” added by compactification, thereby visualizing the rich structure of infinity arising from the unification of space and time.\nBelow are two beautiful TikZ diagrams by Izaak Neutelings. On the left is the Minkowski diagram. Spacetime extends infinitely in all directions. On the right is the Penrose diagram representing the entire spacetime in a finite square.\nMinkowski diagram Penrose Diagram Compactification maps the Minkowski diagram to the Penrose diagram by mapping the null directions to a finite interval. Let’s see how that works.\nMinkowski spacetime Consider the 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime with standard spherical coordinates: $t \\in (-\\infty,\\infty)$, $r \\in [0,\\infty)$, $\\theta\\in[0,\\pi]$, $\\varphi\\in[0,2\\pi)$ with metric $$ ds^2 = -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\\sigma^2, $$ where $d\\sigma^2=d\\theta^2+\\sin^2\\theta d\\varphi^2$. Penrose diagrams are two-dimensional, so we essentially ignore the angular coordinates represented by the $d\\sigma^2$ piece. Each point on the diagram, except the line at the origin, represents a sphere. Spherical light rays propagate along the directions $t+r$ and $t-r$. These directions are called null because they are in the nullspace of the metric.\nUnderlying the Penrose diagrams are coordinates, $T$ and $R$, which compactify these null directions: $$ T+R = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\\arctan}(t+r),$$ $$ T-R = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\\arctan}(t-r). $$ The scale factor $2/\\pi$ is to map the range of the coordinates to $T\\pm R \\in(-1,1)$. Note that I’m not including the endpoints in the intervals yet. The Penrose compactification procedure involves the conformal completion of the spacetime, which adds the points at infinity after a regularizing rescaling. This detail is not relevant for the diagrams but is important for geometry.\nThe Penrose coordinates $(T,R)$ read in terms of the standard $(t,r)$ as: $$ T(t,r) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\left( \\arctan(t+r) + \\arctan(t-r) \\right)$$ $$ R(t,r) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\left( \\arctan(t+r) - \\arctan(t-r) \\right)$$\nLet’s make some plots using these coordinates. I’ll demonstrate plotting time surfaces (level sets of a time coordinate). Say you’d like to draw constant $t$ surfaces in the Penrose diagram. You might be tempted to solve the above relationships for a graph function $T(R;t)$ with constant $t$. But it is easier to let the machine do the work and plot the surfaces parametrically. Define the functions $T(t,r)$ and $R(t,r)$ in TikZ as follows:\n\\tikzset{declare function={ T(\\t,\\r) = \\fpeval{1/pi*(atan(\\t+\\r) + atan(\\t-\\r))}; R(\\t,\\r) = \\fpeval{1/pi*(atan(\\t+\\r) - atan(\\t-\\r))}; }} Then, plot the lines parametrically.\n\\def\\Nlines{6} % total number of lines is 2\\Nlines+1 \\newcommand\\samp[1]{ tan(90*#1) } % for equidistant sampling \\foreach \\i [evaluate={\\t=\\i/(\\Nlines+1);}] in {-\\Nlines,...,\\Nlines}{ \\message{Drawing i=\\i...^^J} \\draw[line width=0.3,samples=30,smooth,variable=\\r,domain=0.001:1] plot({ R(\\samp{\\t},\\samp{\\r}) }, { T(\\samp{\\t},\\samp{\\r}) }); } We’re sampling points fairly evenly by incorporating the compactification into the plot function. As you can see in the diagrams below, the time surfaces are equally separated from each other at the origin. The function samp controls the separation of points in the plot.\nCompactification with arctan (file) Compactification with tanh (file) The two versions of the diagram illustrate a coordinate-dependent feature that confuses even the experts. The $t$ surfaces intersect at spatial infinity, $i^0$, on both diagrams. On the left, they are tangent to each other, while on the right, they are not. So this seems to be a coordinate-dependent feature. Penrose used the inverse tangent function in his original papers. Many other choices exist. For example, using the hyperbolic tangent, the mapping reads $$ T+R = \\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\\tanh}(t+r),$$ $$ T-R = \\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\\tanh}(t-r). $$ This mapping gives the diagram on the right where $t$ surfaces are not tangential at spatial infinity. There’s a subtlety here. …","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"d6602bd077a464bb10ed4c43affd87b9","permalink":"https://hyperboloid.al/post/drawing-penrose-diagrams/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/drawing-penrose-diagrams/","section":"post","summary":"This is the first installment of a three-piece series on Penrose diagrams and the associated conformal compactification procedure.
