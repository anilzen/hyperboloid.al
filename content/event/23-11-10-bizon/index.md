title: Soliton resolution on a wormhole
abstract: Soliton resolution conjecture asserts that generic global-in-time solutions of nonlinear dispersive equations asymptotically resolve into a sum of decoupled nonlinear bound states (solitons) and free radiation. In my talk I will discuss this conjecture in the case of equivariant wave maps on wormholes, emphasizing the advantages of hyperboloidal foliations.
