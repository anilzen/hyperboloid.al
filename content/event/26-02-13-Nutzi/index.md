title: "Perturbations of Minkowski spacetime with regular conformal compactification"
abstract: >
  Using Friedrich's work on the conformal vacuum field equations, one can construct a class of spacetimes with the following properties: They are globally close to Minkowski, identical to a Kerr black hole spacetime near spacelike infinity, and admit a smooth conformal compactification at null infinity. In this talk we construct (assuming appropriate solutions of the constraints) a more general class of spacetimes, that only asymptote to Kerr towards spacelike infinity, but still admit a smooth conformal compactification at null infinity. This is based on a new
