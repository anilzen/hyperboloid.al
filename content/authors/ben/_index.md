I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics](https://www.aei.mpg.de/) (Albert Einstein Institute) in Potsdam, Germany.

My research focus is on modelling gravitational waves from compact binaries, specialising in techniques in extending perturbative calculations in black hole spacetimes.  Currently, my research is focused on developing gravitational self-force calculations that are applicable to more realistic scenarios of systems with a spinning primary and where the smaller companions are in eccentric inspirals. The techniques promise to model both extreme-mass-ratio-inspirals (EMRIs) and intermediate-mass-ratio-inspirals (IMRIs). Furthermore, I have worked on alternative hyperboloidal approaches to black hole perturbation theory that offer to alleviate the computational burdens that current calculations face.
