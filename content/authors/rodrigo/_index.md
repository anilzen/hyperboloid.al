# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I work in the intersection between mathematical relativity, numerical relativity and astrophysics. In the good days, I provide a link between the three fields. In the bad days, I don't belong anywhere.

I am a specialist in applying conformal methods (geometrical tool) with spectral methods (numerical tool) to obtain highly accurate solutions to Einstein’s equations in the context of black-hole dynamics and gravitational waves (astrophysics).
