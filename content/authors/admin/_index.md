Assistant Research Scientist at the [Institute for Physical Science & Technology](https://ipst.umd.edu), [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu) with broad experience in research, administration, and information technologies.

As a researcher, I work on wave equations, null infinity, gravitational waves, weather forecasting, and conservation laws. As an administrator, I bring researchers together in thematically focused but geographically distributed networks. As a technologist, I drive digital transformation to increase the efficiency of business processes that support research and education.
