title: "A hyperboloidal method for numerical simulations of multidimensional nonlinear wave equations"
abstract: We consider the scalar wave equation with power nonlinearity in $n+1$ dimensions. Unlike most previous numerical studies, we go beyond the radial case and do not assume any symmetries for $n=3$, and we only impose an $SO(n-1)$ symmetry in higher dimensions. Our method is based on a hyperboloidal foliation of Minkowski spacetime and conformal compactification. We focus on the late-time power-law decay (tails) of the solutions and compute decay exponents for different spherical harmonic modes, for subcritical, critical and supercritical, focusing and defocusing nonlinear wave equations.
