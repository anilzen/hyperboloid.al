The [Penrose diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_diagram) is a valuable tool in relativity to illustrate the global causal structure of spacetimes[^1]. If you're mainly interested illustrating the essential causal relationships, qualitative diagrams may be sufficient. But for numerical work, it may be important to draw quantitatively correct diagrams.

Below, I show how to draw Penrose diagrams using the LaTeX package TikZ, which [is not a drawing program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ) but a program that draws[^2]. We'll use Python to perform transformations when we hit the computational limitations of TikZ.

TikZ codes for all diagrams below are on my [website repository](https://github.com/anilzen/anilzen.github.io/tree/main/content/post/2022/drawing-penrose-diagrams/tikz).

### The basic idea behind Penrose diagrams

The Penrose diagram is an extension, or better, a *completion* of the [Minkowski diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime_diagram). Just like in the Minkowski diagram, time is vertical, space is horizontal, and null rays are at 45 degrees to the axes. In contrast to the Minkowski diagram, a Penrose diagram includes "points at infinity" added by compactification, thereby visualizing the rich structure of infinity arising from the unification of space and time.


Below are two beautiful [TikZ diagrams](https://tikz.net/relativity_penrose_diagram/) by [Izaak Neutelings](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en/researcharea/cms/people/Izaak-Neutelings.html). On the left is the Minkowski diagram. Spacetime extends infinitely in all directions. On the right is the Penrose diagram, which represents the entire spacetime in a finite square.

The Minkowski diagram on the left is mapped to the Penrose diagram on the right. Compactification maps the null directions to a finite interval. Penrose used the inverse tangent function in his original papers but many other choices exist. We will play with them to illustrate some coordinate-dependent features in these diagrams.

### Minkowski spacetime
Consider the 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime with standard spherical coordinates: $t \in (-\infty,\infty)$, $r \in [0,\infty)$, $\theta\in[0,\pi]$, $\varphi\in[0,2\pi)$. The metric reads
$$ ds^2 = -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2, $$
where $d\sigma^2=d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\varphi^2$, the standard metric on the unit sphere. Penrose diagrams are two-dimensional, so we essentially ignore the angular coordinates (each point, except the origin, represents a sphere). Spherical light rays propagate along the directions $t+r$ and $t-r$. These directions are called [null](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_vector) because they are in the [nullspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(linear_algebra)) of the metric.

The core element of Penrose diagrams are coordinates, $T$ and $R$, which compactify these null directions:
$$ T+R = \frac{2}{\pi}\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\arctan}(t+r),$$ 
$$ T-R = \frac{2}{\pi}\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\arctan}(t-r). $$
The mapped range of the coordinates is $T\in(-1,1)$ and $R\in[0,1)$. Note that I'm not including the endpoints in the intervals yet. The Penrose compactification procedure involves the conformal completion of the spacetime which adds the points at infinity after a regularizing rescaling. This detail is not relevant for the diagrams but is important for geometry.

The Penrose coordinates $(T,R)$ read in terms of the standard $(t,r)$ as:
$$ T(t,r) = \frac{1}{\pi}\left( \arctan(t+r) + \arctan(t-r) \right)$$
$$ R(t,r) = \frac{1}{\pi}\left( \arctan(t+r) - \arctan(t-r) \right)$$

Let's make some plots. I'll demonstrate plotting time surfaces (level sets of a time coordinate). Say, you'd like to draw constant $t$ surfaces in the Penrose diagram. You might be tempted to solve the above relationships for a graph function $T(R;t)$ with constant $t$. But it is easier to let the machine do the work and plot the surfaces parametrically. Define the functions $T(t,r)$ and $R(t,r)$ in TikZ as follows:
```latex
\tikzset{declare function={
    T(\t,\r)  = \fpeval{1/pi*(atan(\t+\r) + atan(\t-\r))};
    R(\t,\r)  = \fpeval{1/pi*(atan(\t+\r) - atan(\t-\r))};
}}
```
Then, plot the lines parametrically. 
```latex
\def\Nlines{6} % total number of lines is 2\Nlines+1
\newcommand\samp[1]{ tan(90*#1) } % for equidistant sampling 
\foreach \i [evaluate={\t=\i/(\Nlines+1);}] in {-\Nlines,...,\Nlines}{
    \message{Drawing i=\i...^^J}
    \draw[line width=0.3,samples=30,smooth,variable=\r,domain=0.001:1]
    plot({ R(\samp{\t},\samp{\r}) }, { T(\samp{\t},\samp{\r}) });
}
```
A neat trick I got from [Neutelings](https://tikz.net/relativity_penrose_diagram/) is the sampling of points by incorporating the compactification into the plot function. As you can see in the diagrams below, the time surfaces are equally separated from each other at the origin. The function `samp` controls the separation of points in the plot.

I plotted two versions of the diagram to illustrate a coordinate-dependent feature that confuses even the experts. On both diagrams, the $t$ surfaces intersect at spatial infinity, $i^0$. On the left diagram, they are tangent to each other, while on the right diagram they are not. The intersection of the $t$ surfaces is an invariant feature, but their behavior near $i^0$ on the Penrose diagram depends on coordinates. The left diagram uses the tangens function for compactification but there are many other functions that map an infinite domain to a finite domain. Using the hyperbolic tangens, the mapping reads
$$ T+R = \textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\tanh}(t+r),$$ 
$$ T-R = \textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\tanh}(t-r). $$
This mapping gives the diagram on the right panel where $t$ surfaces are not tangential at spatial infinity. But there's a subtlety here. Conformal compactification with hyperbolic tangens is not regular when you include the angular dimensions. So be careful what you choose for the mapping.

I draw Penrose diagrams typically to present the causal structure of hyperboloidal surfaces. Such surfaces behave like spacetime hyperboloids: they are spacelike everywhere, including null horizons. In the literature, spacetime hyperboloids are typically defined by the level sets of $\tau$ as
$$ t^2 - r^2 = \tau^2. $$
This construction appears in many models, such as the [Milne model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milne_model) of cosmology, [Dirac's point-form](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.21.392) of relativistic dynamics, the [de Boer-Solodukhin](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0303006) holography of Minowski spacetime, and the [Buchholz-Roberts framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2794) of relativistic QED.

However, these surfaces are not generally useful to study evolution in time because they intersect at future null infinity. It is not immediately obvious from their definition that they do intersect at null infinity if you don't know to look for it. But on the Penrose diagram below, one immediately sees the intersection.

A better option for a foliation of Minkowski spacetime, illustrated on the right panel above, is to fix a hyperboloid, say, with unit radius, and shift it in time by $\tau$, like this
$$ (t-\tau)^2 - r^2 = 1 \implies \tau = t \pm \sqrt{1+r^2}. $$
Choosing the minus sign gives a future hyperboloidalÂ foliation. You can see on the diagram at the right panel that the surfaces do not intersect but provide a smooth foliation of future null infinity.

The causal structure of the time surfaces may not be immediately clear from the formulas. For example, many people find it counterintuitive that hyperboloidal surfaces are spacelike at null infinity or that standard time surfaces intersect at spatial infinity. We can demonstrate such properties by calculations, but it's much easier to view them on a Penrose diagram.

#### Reading data into TikZ
TikZ is limited in its data processing capabilities. As a consequence, the evaluation of the lines in the plots takes a while. Once you move away from Minkowski spacetime, the transformations become too complicated for TikZ. To handle complicated mathematical transformations, you can generate the data for the plots in Python, write them in a file, and plot them with TikZ. Below is the Python code to generate the data files for each time surface.

```python
import numpy as np
t = np.linspace(-np.pi/2.,np.pi/2,14,endpoint=False)[1:]
r = np.linspace(0,np.pi/2,30)
def penrose_coords(r,t):
    R = 1./np.pi*(np.arctan(t+r)-np.arctan(t-r))
    T = 1./np.pi*(np.arctan(t+r)+np.arctan(t-r))
    return R,T
for i, t_val in enumerate(t):
    R,T = penrose_coords(np.tan(r),np.tan(t_val))
    np.savetxt('arctan_data'+str(i)+'.csv',np.stack((R,T)).T, delimiter=',', fmt='%f', header="R,T", comments="")
```

You'll need the [numpy](https://numpy.org/) library installed in your environment (use [local environments for Python!](https://xkcd.com/1987/) The array `t` contains the constant values of the time surfaces; the array `r` includes the samples of the plot parameter. The domains stop at $\pi/2$ because we use the $\tan$ function to sample the points for a relatively even distribution. Then, for each value of `t`, we write the $R,T$ coordinates into a CSV file with headers and some formatting.

On the TikZ side, we simply read these points from the respective files and plot them. To plot data points, I use the library `pgfplots`. The nodes must be drawn with respect to the axis of the plot, which is achieved with the `axis cs:` directive. The relevant part of the code is below.

```latex
 \begin{axis}[axis lines=none, xmin=-.1,xmax=1.1,ymin=-1.2,ymax=1.2,width=0.5\textwidth,height=0.8\textwidth]

    \node[right] at (axis cs:0.6,1) {\small{$\arctan(\cdot)$}};
    \coordinate (O) at (axis cs:0,0) ; % center: origin (r,t) = (0,0)
    \coordinate (S) at ( axis cs:0,-1); % south: t=-infty, i-
    \coordinate (N) at ( axis cs:0, 1); % north: t=+infty, i+
    \coordinate (E) at ( axis cs:1, 0); % east:  r=+infty, i0
    \draw[thick] (N) -- (E) -- (S) -- cycle;

    \newcommand{\scri}{\mathscr{I}} % null infinity
    \node[right] at (E) {$i^0$};
    \node[above] at (N) {$i^+$};
    \node[below] at (S) {$i^-$};
    \node[above, rotate=90] at (O) {\small{$r=0$}};
    \node[above right] at (axis cs: 0.5,0.5) {$\scri^+$};
    \node[below right] at (axis cs: 0.5,-0.5) {$\scri^-$};
    
    \foreach \file in {{arctan_data0.csv},{arctan_data1.csv},{arctan_data2.csv},{arctan_data3.csv},
    			    {arctan_data4.csv},{arctan_data5.csv},{arctan_data6.csv}}
  	  {\addplot[domain={-1,1}] table [x=R, y=T, col sep=comma] {\file};}

\end{axis}
```
This is probably not the most elegant solution, but it works. If you're up for it, you might prefer using a Python library such as [tikzplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/tikzplotlib/) to avoid going back and forth between Python and TikZ.

### Schwarzschild spacetime
The Schwarzschild line element in Droste coordinates reads
$$ ds^2 = - f(r) dt^2 + \frac{1}{f(r)} dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2, \tag{SS} \label{1}$$
where
$$ f(r) = 1-\frac{2 M}{r},$$
or in dimensionless coordinates
$$ f(r) = 1-\frac{1}{r}.$$
Dimensionless coordinates are similar to setting $M=1/2$.

The metric is singular where $f(r)$ vanishes, at $r=1$. This surface is the [event horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon), but the metric singularity is a coordinate artefact. It is [arguably more natural](anilzen.github.io/publication/zenginoglu-2011-geometric/) to use coordinates that are regular across the event horizon, such as the [GullstrandâPainlevÃ©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullstrand%E2%80%93Painlev%C3%A9_coordinates) or the [EddingtonâFinkelstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddington%E2%80%93Finkelstein_coordinates) coordinates. In fact, we must use such coordinates to draw Penrose diagrams.

Penrose diagrams for Schwarzschild spacetime are traditionally drawn using a compactification of [Kruskal coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%E2%80%93Szekeres_coordinates). Let's copy them from Wikipedia (for a derivation, see, for example, the Appendix of my [thesis](anilzen.github.io/publication/zenginoglu-2007-conformal/)):
$$ \tau = (r-1) e^r \sinh \tfrac{t}{2}, $$
$$ \rho = (r-1) e^r \cosh \tfrac{t}{2}. $$
The coordinates of the Penrose diagram are compactified along the null directions just as in the Minkowski case:
$$ T = \frac{1}{\pi}\left( \arctan(\tau+\rho) + \arctan(\tau-\rho) \right)$$
$$ R = \frac{1}{\pi}\left( \arctan(\tau+\rho) - \arctan(\tau-\rho) \right)$$
The transformations are more complicated, so we will use Python codes to generate the lines and plot them with TikZ. Here's the Python function to construct the compactified Kruskal coordinates.
```python
def kruskal_coords(r, t):
    rho = np.sqrt(r-1)*np.exp(r/2)*np.cosh(t/2)
    tau = np.sqrt(r-1)*np.exp(r/2)*np.sinh(t/2)
    R = 2./np.pi*(np.arctan(tau+rho)-np.arctan(tau-rho))
    T = 2./np.pi*(np.arctan(tau+rho)+np.arctan(tau-rho))
    return R, T
```
I construct Schwarzschild radial points from tortoise coordinates that are on Chebyshev nodes because I want more points at the end points closer to the horizon and infinity than at the inner points. There are different, possibly more effective ways of achieving such a beneficial point distribution, but this method works sufficiently well for the diagrams.
```python
t_vals = np.linspace(-3., 3, 7)
r_tort = np.tan(np.pi/2*np.cos(np.pi * np.arange(0, 30+1) / 30))[::-1][2:-1]
r_schw = np.real(lambertw(np.exp(r_tort-1))+1)

for i, t_val in enumerate(t_vals):
    R, T = kruskal_coords(r_schw, t_val)
    fn = 'data/ss'+str(i)+'.csv'
    np.savetxt(fn, np.stack((R, T)).T,
               delimiter=',', fmt='%f', header="R,T", comments="")
    print('{'+fn+'},')
```
As you can immediately see from the Penrose diagram, the Schwarzschild time slices intersect at the bifurcation sphere, $\mathcal{B}$ and at spatial infinity $i^0$. When you're interested in behavior of fields near the black hole and far away from it (say, to study gravitational waves), it's better to use non-intersecting time slices.

Most useful time functions are related to the Schwarzschild time by a shift in height that depends only on the radial coordinate:
$$ t \to t + h(r). $$
For example, the height function for [GullstrandâPainlevÃ©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullstrand%E2%80%93Painlev%C3%A9_coordinates) coordinates is
$$ h_{\rm GP} (r) = -2 \sqrt{r} + \ln\frac{\sqrt{r}+1}{\sqrt{r}-1}. $$
Note that the height function is singular at the horizon. This singularity is needed to counteract the singularity of Schwarzschild time slices near the bifurcation sphere. GullstrandâPainlevÃ© gives a nice foliation of the future event horizon, $\mathcal{H}^+$. But you can also see that the time slices still intersect at spatial infinity.

We need a height function that's singular both near and far from the black hole. This idea underlies the construction of hyperboloidal coordinates. For example, 
$$ h_{\rm Hyp} (r) = \sqrt{1+ r_\ast^2}, $$
gives the hyperboloidal foliation on the left panel. The slices do not intersect. Instead, you get a nice, smooth foliation of the full exterior domain. The minimal gauge of [Ansorg, Jaramillo, and Macedo](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02837) with the height function
$$ h_{\rm MG} (r) = r + 2 \ln r - \ln(r - 1), $$
has a similar behavior as depicted on the right panel.

Similar constructions can be made also for Kerr, ReissnerâNordstrÃ¶m, or Schwarzschild-de Sitter metrics. If you have any questions about the diagrams or the source files, feel free to email me at anil@umd.edu. 

I plan to write two more posts on Penrose compactification. Stay tuned!


<!-- These coordinates are good for plotting the maximally extended Schwarzschild solution but they are too complicated if you're primarily interested in the exterior region. You can draw a Penrose diagram for Schwarzschild just like in the Minkowski case by using the tortoise coordinate. The reason is that the $t,r$ portion of the Schwarzschild metric is conformally flat in the tortoise coordinate. Since Penrose diagrams are conformal diagrams, all the usual tricks apply. -->


<!-- The Schwarzschild case reduces to the Minkowski case when we switch to the tortoise coordinate (up to a constant)
$$ r_\ast = \int \frac{dr}{f(r)} = r + 2 M \log \left(\frac{r}{2M}-1\right).$$
The Schwarzschild metric \eqref{1} becomes
$$ ds^2 = f(r(r_\ast)) (- dt^2 + dr_\ast^2) + r(r_\ast)^2 d\sigma^2. $$
Ignoring the angular part, the spacetime metric is just a conformal Minkowski metric in coordinates $(t,r_\ast)$ with in- and outgoing coordinates $t+r_\ast$ and $t-r_\ast$. For a Penrose diagram, you can consider the Schwarzschild metric to be simply $ -dt^2 + dr_\ast^2$. The main difference is the domain of $r_\ast$. While the domain of $r$ in Minkowski is $[0,\infty)$, the domain of the tortoise coordinate $r_\ast$ in Schwarzschild is $(-\infty, \infty)$. This difference is why the Minkowski conformal diagram is a triangle, whereas the conformal diagram for the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime is a diamond.  -->
