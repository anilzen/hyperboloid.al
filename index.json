The hyperboloidal approach provides incredible efficiencies in the computation of wave equations across large domains. It also offers insights into the role of coordinates and observers in relativity, energy propagation, and the arrow of time.\nThe recognition of the hyperbolic nature of time slices in relativity has been dormant since first emphasized by Minkowski in 1909, except for a few dedicated researchers exploring the topic. However, the hyperboloidal approach has recently gained wide recognition as a valuable tool for studying wave propagation problems. They have been successfully employed in a wide range of problems covering mathematical analysis of nonlinear wave equations and different flavors of black-hole perturbation theory, including the effective-one-body and self-force approaches. We combine mathematical and numerical tools from differential geometry, conformal structure, partial differential equations, and numerical analysis to improve the study and computation of waves.\nThis website promotes the hyperboloidal approach to researchers and the public. Through conferences, virtual seminars, expository blog posts, and review papers, our team aims to make this topic more widely known. It is hoped that this coordinated effort will help resolve the remaining open problems in this area.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://hyperboloid.al/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"Hyperboloidal foliations have recently started playing a fundamental role in the numerical computation and analysis of wave propagation problems across various research areas.

Often, qualitative diagrams are sufficient if you’re mainly interested in the essential causal relationships. But sometimes, for numerical work or for your own understanding, you need a quantitatively correct diagram.\nBelow, we draw Penrose diagrams using free and open-source software. We’ll draw the diagrams using the LaTeX package TikZ (not a drawing program but a program that draws2). We’ll use Python to perform transformations when we hit the computational limitations of TikZ.\nThe code for all diagrams below is on my website repository. The basic idea behind Penrose diagrams The Penrose diagram is an extension, or better, a completion of the Minkowski diagram. Like in the Minkowski diagram, time is vertical, space is horizontal, and null rays are at 45 degrees to the axes. In contrast to the Minkowski diagram, a Penrose diagram includes “points at infinity” added by compactification, thereby visualizing the rich structure of infinity arising from the unification of space and time.\nBelow are two beautiful TikZ diagrams by Izaak Neutelings. On the left is the Minkowski diagram. Spacetime extends infinitely in all directions. On the right is the Penrose diagram representing the entire spacetime in a finite square.\nMinkowski diagram Penrose Diagram Compactification maps the Minkowski diagram to the Penrose diagram by mapping the null directions to a finite interval. Let’s see how that works.\nMinkowski spacetime Consider the 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime with standard spherical coordinates: $t \\in (-\\infty,\\infty)$, $r \\in [0,\\infty)$, $\\theta\\in[0,\\pi]$, $\\varphi\\in[0,2\\pi)$ with metric $$ ds^2 = -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\\sigma^2, $$ where $d\\sigma^2=d\\theta^2+\\sin^2\\theta d\\varphi^2$. Penrose diagrams are two-dimensional, so we essentially ignore the angular coordinates represented by the $d\\sigma^2$ piece. Each point on the diagram, except the line at the origin, represents a sphere. Spherical light rays propagate along the directions $t+r$ and $t-r$. These directions are called null because they are in the nullspace of the metric.\nUnderlying the Penrose diagrams are coordinates, $T$ and $R$, which compactify these null directions: $$ T+R = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\\arctan}(t+r),$$ $$ T-R = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\\arctan}(t-r). $$ The scale factor $2/\\pi$ is to map the range of the coordinates to $T\\pm R \\in(-1,1)$. Note that I’m not including the endpoints in the intervals yet. The Penrose compactification procedure involves the conformal completion of the spacetime, which adds the points at infinity after a regularizing rescaling. This detail is not relevant for the diagrams but is important for geometry.\nThe Penrose coordinates $(T,R)$ read in terms of the standard $(t,r)$ as: $$ T(t,r) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\left( \\arctan(t+r) + \\arctan(t-r) \\right)$$ $$ R(t,r) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\left( \\arctan(t+r) - \\arctan(t-r) \\right)$$\nLet’s make some plots using these coordinates. I’ll demonstrate plotting time surfaces (level sets of a time coordinate). Say you’d like to draw constant $t$ surfaces in the Penrose diagram. You might be tempted to solve the above relationships for a graph function $T(R;t)$ with constant $t$. But it is easier to let the machine do the work and plot the surfaces parametrically. Define the functions $T(t,r)$ and $R(t,r)$ in TikZ as follows:\n\\tikzset{declare function={ T(\\t,\\r) = \\fpeval{1/pi*(atan(\\t+\\r) + atan(\\t-\\r))}; R(\\t,\\r) = \\fpeval{1/pi*(atan(\\t+\\r) - atan(\\t-\\r))}; }} Then, plot the lines parametrically.\n\\def\\Nlines{6} % total number of lines is 2\\Nlines+1 \\newcommand\\samp[1]{ tan(90*#1) } % for equidistant sampling \\foreach \\i [evaluate={\\t=\\i/(\\Nlines+1);}] in {-\\Nlines,...,\\Nlines}{ \\message{Drawing i=\\i...^^J} \\draw[line width=0.3,samples=30,smooth,variable=\\r,domain=0.001:1] plot({ R(\\samp{\\t},\\samp{\\r}) }, { T(\\samp{\\t},\\samp{\\r}) }); } We’re sampling points fairly evenly by incorporating the compactification into the plot function. As you can see in the diagrams below, the time surfaces are equally separated from each other at the origin. The function samp controls the separation of points in the plot.\nCompactification with arctan (file) Compactification with tanh (file) The two versions of the diagram illustrate a coordinate-dependent feature that confuses even the experts. The $t$ surfaces intersect at spatial infinity, $i^0$, on both diagrams. On the left, they are tangent to each other, while on the right, they are not. So this seems to be a coordinate-dependent feature. Penrose used the inverse tangent function in his original papers. Many other choices exist. For example, using the hyperbolic tangent, the mapping reads $$ T+R = \\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\\tanh}(t+r),$$ $$ T-R = \\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\\tanh}(t-r). $$ This mapping gives the diagram on the right where $t$ surfaces are not tangential at spatial infinity. There’s a subtlety here. …","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"d6602bd077a464bb10ed4c43affd87b9","permalink":"https://hyperboloid.al/post/drawing-penrose-diagrams/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/drawing-penrose-diagrams/","section":"post","summary":"This is the first installment of a three-piece series on Penrose diagrams and the associated conformal compactification procedure.
