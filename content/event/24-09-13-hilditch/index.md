title: "Generalized harmonic gauge on compactified hyperboloidal slices"
abstract: I will give an update on our progress toward numerical treatment of the hyperboloidal initial value problem with the generalized harmonic gauge formulation using a dual-foliation setup. This will include an overview of our general strategy, spherical and 3D toy models, the comprehensive treatment of spherical GR, and finally, a discussion of what remains to be done in the full 3D case.
# , bookending the historical narrative. If time remains, I will discuss the fundamental relevance of hyperboloidal time by demonstrating why coordinates matter even with covariance and speculate about the potential role of hyperboloidal time in quantum gravity.
