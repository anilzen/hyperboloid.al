title: "Hyperboloidal neutron star and black hole in spherical symmetry"
abstract: "This work constructs initial data for a neutron star on a hyperboloidal slice. This first step involves spherical symmetry and a polytropic equation of state for the neutron star. Constraint-satisfying compactified hyperboloidal initial data are obtained for a single neutron star and for a combination of a neutron star with a small black hole in its center. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time that full hyperboloidal slices including a neutron star are constructed. These initial data will be used in hyperboloidal evolutions of the Einstein and hydrodynamic equations in the future."
