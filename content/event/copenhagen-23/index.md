summary: Hyperboloidal compactification and its applications with a focus on Einstein equations.
abstract: 'In recent years, hyperboloidal methods have started to play a critical role in black-hole perturbation theory as they have expanded into diverse applications such as the computation of long-time wave equations, quasi-normal modes, alternative theories of gravity, effective-one-body formalism, and self-force. Extensive progress has been achieved during the past decade, with many developments targeting the generic solution of nonlinear Einstein equations. 
<h3>Goals</h3>
This workshop aims to bring together leading experts to review and summarize the progress in hyperboloidal methods. Our goal is to assess the current state-of-the-art of these methods in a wide range of applications and to foster new collaborations. We will particularly focus on solving the full Einstein equations for astrophysically relevant scenarios.'
