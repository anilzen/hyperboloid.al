As a thematically focused but geographically distributed network, we hold virtual events via Zoom to exchange ideas. Our monthly virtual seminars are recorded. The first virtual seminar of the series will take place in October on Friday the 13th, 2023, at 14:00 GMT.  Rodrigo Panosso Macedo will discuss the construction of minimal gauges in various spacetimes based on [recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15735).
